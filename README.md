- Predictive orbital path trails

### Graphics
- Orbital trails for prominent bodies (over a mass threshold)
- Dynamic shadows for bodies
- Stellar bloom
- Comet trails (dust and gas)
- Screen culling (for performance)

### Controls
- Camera movement (arrow keys)
- Camera zoom (+/-)
- Time step
- Object targetting

### Simulation manipulation
